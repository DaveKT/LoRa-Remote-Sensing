###Deployment

//TODO

#####SPECIAL NOTICE

Note that this radio breakout is designed to send on frequencies that are open for use in the US without a license. It is possible, however, to configure the radio to operate in the US Amateur bands. If you are not a licensed US radio amateur operator do not alter the frequency. Also, if you wish to operate outside of the US Adafruit offers radios that transmit on alternate frequencies. See product site for more details.
